# Project Overview
  The Amazon Clone is a frontend-only project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides users with a simplified version of Amazon’s interface, allowing them to browse products, add items to their cart, and simulate the checkout process. While it doesn’t have real backend functionality (such as user authentication or payment processing), it serves as a great learning exercise for frontend development.
